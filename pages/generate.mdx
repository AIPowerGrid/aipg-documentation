# Generate AI

Create images, chat with LLMs, and generate media using The Grid's decentralized AI network.

## Den (電) - Your Credits

Den is the platform currency for AI generation.

- **New users** get Den when signing up
- **Workers** accrue more Den for contributing GPU power
- **Spend Den** to generate images, text, and media

We're currently giving generous amounts of Den so you can explore freely.

## Generate Images

### aipg.art

[aipg.art](https://aipg.art) is the AI art gallery powered by The Grid.

**What you can do:**
- Generate images with Flux, SDXL, Stable Diffusion, and more
- Browse community creations
- Use pre-built workflows or customize parameters
- Download your generations

**How to use:**
1. Go to [aipg.art](https://aipg.art)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Enter your prompt
4. Choose a model and settings
5. Generate

**Available Models:**

| Model | Best For | VRAM on Worker |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Flux** | Highest quality, photorealism | 12GB+ |
| **SDXL** | High-res, detailed images | 8GB+ |
| **SD 1.5** | Fast generations, wide LoRA support | 6GB+ |

**Parameters you can adjust:**
- Steps (quality vs speed)
- CFG scale (prompt adherence)
- Sampler and scheduler
- Dimensions
- Seed (for reproducibility)

### NFTs (Coming Soon)

Mint your generations as on-chain NFTs with **full reproducibility**.

Unlike typical NFT JPEGs with IPFS links that can rot, Grid NFTs store all generation parameters on the blockchain:
- Model hash
- Prompt and negative prompt
- Seed, steps, CFG, sampler
- Workflow recipe

Anyone with the model can regenerate the exact image from chain data alone. Future-proof, verifiable, truly ownable AI art.

## Chat with AI

### aipg.chat

[aipg.chat](https://aipg.chat) is an OpenWebUI-powered chat interface running on The Grid.

**What you get:**
- Chat with open-source LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc.)
- No corporate API middleman
- Decentralized inference via Grid workers
- Conversation history

**How to use:**
1. Go to [aipg.chat](https://aipg.chat)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Select a model
4. Start chatting

The responses come from real GPUs running real models—no API wrappers, no OpenAI under the hood.

## Use the API

For programmatic access, use The Grid API directly.

### Get Your API Key

1. Go to [dashboard.aipowergrid.io](https://dashboard.aipowergrid.io)
   - Or register at [api.aipowergrid.io/register](https://api.aipowergrid.io/register)
2. Create an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Check your usage at [api.aipowergrid.io](https://api.aipowergrid.io)

### SDK

Use the official SDK for easier integration:

**Repository:** [github.com/AIPowerGrid/grid-sdk](https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/grid-sdk)

```javascript
import { GridClient } from '@aipowergrid/sdk';

const grid = new GridClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Generate an image
const result = await grid.generate({
  prompt: 'a robot painting a sunset',
  model: 'flux-schnell',
  width: 1024,
  height: 1024
});

console.log(result.imageUrl);
```

### Image Generation
- Flux.1 (Schnell, Dev)
- SDXL and variants
- Stable Diffusion 1.5
- Inpainting models
- ControlNet (Canny, Depth, Pose)

### Text Generation
- Llama (various sizes)
- Mistral
- Qwen
- Other Ollama-compatible models

### Coming Soon
- Video generation
- Audio/music generation

Models are continuously being added. The ModelVault on Base mainnet ensures only verified models are available.

## Tips

**For better images:**
- Be specific in prompts
- Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements
- Higher steps = more detail (but slower)
- Same seed + same settings = same image

**For faster generations:**
- Use Flux Schnell for quick iterations
- Lower step counts for drafts
- Generate at smaller sizes, upscale after

**For chat:**
- Larger models give better responses but may be slower
- Be clear and specific in your questions
- The model only knows what it was trained on (no real-time info)
