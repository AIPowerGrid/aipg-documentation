# 🤖 Simple Text Worker Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running a Simple Text Worker for the AI Power Grid. The Simple Text Worker allows you to contribute your GPU resources to the grid for text generation tasks and earn AIPG in return.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, PopOS, or similar distributions)
- Python 3 or higher installed
- Docker installed and configured
- A GPU with enough VRAM to run your chosen model
- An AIPG API key (obtainable from [dashboard.aipowergrid.io](https://dashboard.aipowergrid.io))

> **Note on Windows Compatibility**: While this guide focuses on Linux, the Simple Text Worker may also run on Windows systems. However, this has not yet been officially confirmed by community or team members. If you're running Windows, you might be able to use Docker Desktop for Windows or WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with similar results.

## 🐳 Step 1: Install Docker

If you don't have Docker installed yet, follow these steps to install it on your Linux system.

### Installing Docker on Ubuntu/PopOS

The Docker installation package available in the official Ubuntu repository may not be the latest version. To ensure you get the latest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository:

1. Update your existing package list:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install prerequisite packages:
```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

3. Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

4. Add the Docker repository to APT sources:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
```

5. Update the package database with Docker packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

6. Verify you're installing from the Docker repo:
```bash
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

7. Install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

8. Check that Docker is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### 🔑 Configure Docker to Run Without Sudo (Required)

It's essential to be able to run Docker commands without sudo for the Simple Text Worker to function properly:

1. Add your username to the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

2. Apply the new group membership (either log out and back in, or use):
```bash
su - ${USER}
```

3. Verify your user was added to the docker group:
```bash
groups
```

4. Test Docker is working properly without sudo:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

5. Make sure you can run `docker ps` without sudo:
```bash
docker ps
```

## 🛠️ Step 2: Set Up the Simple Text Worker

Now that Docker is installed and working, let's set up the Simple Text Worker:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/simple-text-worker
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd simple-text-worker
```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will ensure you have all the necessary Python packages, including GPUtil and other dependencies.

4. Install additional dependencies that may be needed:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet] GPUtil
```

5. Create a configuration file by copying the template:
```bash
cp bridgeData_template.yaml bridgeData.yaml
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure the Worker

Edit the `bridgeData.yaml` file to configure your worker:

```bash
nano bridgeData.yaml
```

Here are the key configuration options:

### 🧠 Model Selection
```yaml
model_name: "stabilityai/stable-code-3b"
```
You can set this to any model available on HuggingFace that you want to run.

### 🖥️ UI Settings
```yaml
terminal_ui_enabled: false  # Setting this to true is not recommended at the moment
```

### 🌐 Grid API Connection
```yaml
horde_url: "https://api.aipowergrid.io/"
api_key: ""  # Insert your API key from dashboard.aipowergrid.io
```

### ⚡ Performance Settings
```yaml
max_threads: 1  # Number of concurrent tasks
queue_size: 0   # Keep recommended for initial setup
gpu_count: 1    # Number of GPUs to use
```

### 🏷️ Worker Identity
```yaml
scribe_name: ""  # Your AIPG address (recommended format)
```
For the `scribe_name`, use your AIPG address for simplicity. Advanced users can use formats like `AIPG_ADDR.NAME` or `AIPG_ADDR_NAME` once comfortable with the system.

### 🔌 Local API Connection
```yaml
kai_url: "http://localhost:2242"  # Default is fine, no need to change
```

### 🔄 Text Generation Parameters
```yaml
max_length: 1500          # Maximum tokens to generate
max_context_length: 32000  # Maximum tokens from the prompt
```

### 💻 Hardware Compatibility
```yaml
old_nvidia_compute: true  # Set to false if you have a card newer than the 2080 Ti
```

## 🚀 Step 4: Launch the Worker

After configuring your worker, you can start it with:

```bash
python3 start_worker.py
```
Or depending on your Python configuration:
```bash
python start_worker.py
```

### 🔄 Launch Process

1. The system will first launch Aphrodite-engine, which is the workhorse component.
2. The model will be downloaded from HuggingFace (this can take some time depending on your internet connection).
3. Once the model is downloaded, Aphrodite will attempt to load it into your GPU.
4. If successful, you'll see logs indicating a connection can be made to the KAI URL specified in your configuration.
5. At this point, you can press Enter to switch to launching the grid worker itself.
6. The grid worker will connect to the AIPG network and start accepting jobs.

## 🔄 Step 5: Running the Worker in the Background (Recommended)

For long-term operation, it's recommended to run the worker in the background using tmux, which allows you to detach from the session while keeping it running:

### 📦 Installing tmux
If you don't have tmux installed:
```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

### 🖥️ Using tmux to Run Your Worker
1. Start a new tmux session:
```bash
tmux
```

2. Launch the worker as normal:
```bash
python3 start_worker.py
```

3. Once the worker is running, detach from the tmux session by pressing:
```
Ctrl+b followed by d
```
This will keep the worker running in the background even after you close your terminal.

### 📋 Managing tmux Sessions
- To list all active tmux sessions:
```bash
tmux ls
```

- To reattach to your session:
```bash
tmux attach-session
```

- If you have multiple sessions, attach to a specific one:
```bash
tmux attach-session -t <session-number>
```
Replace `<session-number>` with the session ID (e.g., 0, 1, 2) shown in the `tmux ls` output.

This method makes it easy to check on your worker's status when needed while keeping it running continuously in the background.

## 📊 Step 6: Monitoring Your Worker

You can monitor your worker's status and performance at [dashboard.aipowergrid.io](https://dashboard.aipowergrid.io).

## 🛑 Shutting Down the Worker

The shutdown process involves two steps:

1. Press Ctrl+C to stop the grid worker (this does not stop Aphrodite-engine).
2. To completely shut down, including Aphrodite-engine:
   ```bash
   docker ps  # Find the container ID for Aphrodite
   docker kill <container_id>  # Kill the Aphrodite container
   ```

If you're running in a tmux session, first reattach to the session:
```bash
tmux attach-session
```
Then follow the shutdown steps above.

This two-step shutdown process is designed to prevent long loading times when restarting with changed settings, as loading the model into GPU memory can be time-consuming.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 🔒 HTTPS Download Warning
If you see a warning about downloading models with HTTPS and needing to install `huggingface_hub[hf_xet]`:
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[hf_xet]
```

#### 📦 Missing GPUtil
If the application crashes when launching the bridge worker due to missing GPUtil:
```bash
pip install GPUtil
```

#### 📚 Other Python Dependencies
You might need to install additional Python packages if you encounter errors:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 🧠 GPU Memory Issues
If Aphrodite crashes after downloading the model, you might not have enough VRAM. Try:
- Using a smaller model
- Reducing `max_context_length`
- Making sure no other applications are using your GPU

#### 🐳 Docker Permission Issues
If you see "permission denied" when running Docker commands, make sure you've properly set up Docker to run without sudo and have logged out and back in to apply the group changes.
