# The Grid

The Grid is a decentralized AI inference network. GPU owners run workers, users generate AI content, and everything is powered by AIPG tokens on Base.

1. **You request** - Submit a prompt via aipg.art, aipg.chat, or the API
2. **Workers generate** - Decentralized GPU nodes run AI models
3. **You receive** - Get your image, text, or other AI output
4. **Workers earn** - GPU operators earn AIPG for their compute

## What You Can Do

### Generate Images

Create AI art at [aipg.art](https://aipg.art) using models like Flux, SDXL, and Stable Diffusion. Choose from thousands of workflows, adjust parameters, and generate.

Coming soon: **Mint your generations as NFTs** with full on-chain reproducibility. Every parameter stored on the blockchain—the image can be regenerated from chain data alone.

### Chat with AI

Use [aipg.chat](https://aipg.chat) for text conversations powered by LLMs running on The Grid. Open-source models, no corporate API, decentralized inference.

### Build with the API

Get an API key at [dashboard.aipowergrid.io](https://dashboard.aipowergrid.io) and integrate AI generation into your apps. View stats and usage at [api.aipowergrid.io](https://api.aipowergrid.io).

### Run a Worker

Contribute your GPU to The Grid. Run inference (text) or media (image/video/audio) workers and earn AIPG rewards based on the work you complete.

### Stake AIPG

Stake your AIPG tokens to earn passive rewards. No lockup period—withdraw anytime.

## The Economy

### Den (電) - Platform Credits

Den is your balance for AI generation on The Grid.

- **Sign up** → Get Den to start generating
- **Run a worker** → Accrue more Den
- **Spend Den** → Pay for generations

Right now we're giving generous amounts of Den so you can explore and create freely.

### AIPG Token

AIPG is the native token of AI Power Grid on Base L2.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Network** | Base (Coinbase L2) |
| **Supply** | 150M (fixed, no inflation) |
| **Contract** | `0xa1c0deCaFE3E9Bf06A5F29B7015CD373a9854608` |

**Get AIPG**: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?outputCurrency=0xa1c0decafe3e9bf06a5f29b7015cd373a9854608)

AIPG is used for:
- **Staking** → Earn rewards
- **Worker bonding** → Become a trusted worker
- **Worker rewards** → Earn for running GPU nodes

---

## The Architecture

The Grid runs on smart contracts deployed to Base mainnet. The system is modular—new capabilities can be added without redeploying everything.

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **ModelVault** | Registry of AI models (Flux, SDXL, LLMs, etc.) |
| **RecipeVault** | Stored workflows for reproducible generation |
| **JobAnchor** | On-chain verification of completed jobs |
| **WorkerRegistry** | Worker registration and bonding |
| **StakingVault** | Stake AIPG, earn rewards |

### Why Base?

- Fast transactions (~2 second blocks)
- Low fees (~$0.01 per tx)
- Ethereum security (L2 rollup)
- Coinbase ecosystem
