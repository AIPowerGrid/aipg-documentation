# About AI Power Grid

We're building the infrastructure for decentralized AI.

---

## The Mission

Make AI accessible to everyone. No corporate gatekeepers. No API rate limits. No surveillance of your prompts. Just open-source models running on community hardware.

The Grid is what happens when you combine:
- **GPU owners** who want to earn from their hardware
- **Users** who want AI without the strings attached
- **Developers** who want to build without platform risk
- **Blockchain** to coordinate it all trustlessly

## What We've Built

### The Network

**The Grid** - A decentralized network of GPU workers running AI models. Text, images, video, and audio generation distributed across community hardware.

- **[aipg.art](https://aipg.art)** - AI art generation
- **[aipg.chat](https://aipg.chat)** - LLM chat interface
- **[API](https://dashboard.aipowergrid.io)** - Programmatic access

### The Infrastructure

**Smart contracts on Base** - Model registry, workflow storage, job verification, worker bonding, staking rewards. All on-chain, all verifiable.

- **ModelVault** - Registry of verified AI models
- **RecipeVault** - Stored workflows for reproducible generation
- **JobAnchor** - On-chain proofs for completed work
- **StakingVault** - Stake AIPG, earn rewards

### The Token

**AIPG on Base L2** - 150M fixed supply, no inflation. Used for staking, worker rewards, and bonding.

## What We Believe

**AI should be a utility, not a product.** Like electricity, it should be infrastructure anyone can tap into.

**Open source wins.** Closed models create dependency. Open models create possibility.

**Decentralization matters.** Not as ideology, but as architecture. No single point of failure. No single point of control.

**Builders should own their stack.** If you build on a platform, you're at the platform's mercy. Build on The Grid, own your infrastructure.
