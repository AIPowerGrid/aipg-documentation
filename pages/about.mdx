# About This Documentation

## Overview

This documentation serves as the official resource for information about the AI Power Grid project. It provides comprehensive details about the platform, tokenomics, technical implementations, and ecosystem components.

## Documentation System

### MDX Format

These docs are written in MDX format, which combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of JSX. This allows for:

- **Rich Content**: Standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, links, and code blocks
- **Dynamic Components**: Integration of React components within the documentation
- **Interactive Elements**: Embedding of interactive elements like code playgrounds and diagrams

MDX enables us to create documentation that is both easy to write and highly functional, making complex technical concepts more accessible through visual and interactive elements.

### Local Development

You can run these docs locally on your machine to preview changes before submitting them:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/aipowergrid/aipg-documentation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server: `pnpm run dev`
4. Access the docs at `http://localhost:3000`

Local development allows you to see how your changes will look in production before submitting them.

### Continuous Deployment

Our documentation follows a continuous deployment model:

- **Automatic Updates**: Pull requests merged into the main branch are automatically deployed to production
- **Preview Deployments**: PRs generate preview links so changes can be reviewed before merging
- **Version Control**: All documentation changes are tracked through Git, allowing for easy rollbacks and history tracking

This approach ensures that the most up-to-date information is always available to users while maintaining a structured review process.
